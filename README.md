# DESRES_snippet
Code snippet for Dynamic Memory Allocator (from CMU 15-213 Malloc Lab).
See mm.c for my code!


About 1k lines of code were given as starter code (mostly smaller helper functions), with the remaining 1.5k lines composing the full implementation of a dynamic memory allocator with segregated free lists.
